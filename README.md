The asssigned task focuses on sentiment analysis, a natural language processing technique that identifies and extracts
subjective information through contextual mining of text. It is
often useful when the analysis is conducted on tweets where
the point of view and contentions are remarkably unstructured

selection and feature engineering steps as well as a suited text
cleaning stage, and we conduct a comparative analysis of machine
learning algorithms for sentiment classification, like Logistic
Regression, Decision Trees and Support Vector Machine, together
with evaluation metrics
